# Real Estate Web Platform

This is a real estate web project I'm building with Django and TailwindCSS.  
The idea is to create a clean, modern interface for exploring premium properties, managing listings, and helping agents work more efficiently.

---

## 🛠️ Stack

- Backend: Django (Python)
- Frontend: Django templates + TailwindCSS  
- Currently using local rendering with Tailwind; planning to improve structure and responsiveness.

---

## 📌 Features (in progress)

- User registration & profile pages  
- Property listings and detail pages  
- Agent cards with contact info  
- Custom property collections ("Favorites")  
- Clean UI based on a Figma mockup  

This is still early work — parts of the project are being redesigned and tested. The styles and layout are gradually moving toward the final look.

## ⚙️ Setup

If you want to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repo
2. Set up a virtual environment
3. Install Django (pip install django)
4. Run the server:  
   `bash
   python manage.py runserver

5. In another terminal, run Tailwind (i'm using local compilation with npx tailwindcss ...)



Tailwind files are located inside the theme/static_src/ directory.

🔄 Status

Still in development.
Some pages may be missing or incomplete. The frontend is being gradually adapted to the Figma design.

💬 Notes

This project is part of my learning journey and portfolio.
I'm planning to deploy it later and connect the backend to a more structured frontend.
